        <h2>About Green Line Trades</h2>
        <p>
          Green Line Trade facilitates cross-community commerce in Cyprus, connecting suppliers and buyers across the Green Line. Green Line Trade refers to the special trading arrangement that allows goods and people to move between the two parts of Cyprus — the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and the northern area not under its effective control — across what is known as the Green Line. This line has divided the island since 1974 and is overseen by the United Nations.

          Although the entire island is technically part of the European Union, EU law is currently suspended in the northern part. To bridge this gap, the Green Line Regulation (EU Regulation 866/2004) was introduced. It enables the flow of approved goods and services from the north to the south under controlled conditions, ensuring safety, transparency, and compliance with EU standards.
          
          Over time, this system has helped foster cooperation, economic exchange, and trust between the communities. One key success story is the cross-border trade of local products like halloumi/hellim cheese, which has gained recognition under EU law.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            GreenLineTrades is a modern portal built to support and grow this important trade channel. Our mission is to make cross-Green Line commerce easier, safer, and more connected.

            We serve as a digital meeting point for suppliers and buyers on both sides of the island — streamlining communication, improving visibility, and helping businesses adhere to EU requirements like food safety, origin documentation, and plant health regulations.
            
            We also align with the values and goals of the EU One Stop Shop (OSS), a European Commission initiative that supports businesses engaged in Green Line Trade. Like the OSS, we aim to:
            
                Increase awareness of trade opportunities across the Green Line
            
                Provide reliable information on rules, regulations, and quality standards
            
                Encourage cross-community cooperation and business networking
            
                Help businesses grow in a spirit of peace, partnership, and prosperity
